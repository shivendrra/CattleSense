# CattleSense

A Digital Farm Management Portal for Monitoring Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) and Antimicrobial Usage (AMU) in Livestock

## Overview

**CattleSense** is a digital platform designed to monitor and manage **Antimicrobial Usage (AMU)** and ensure compliance with **Maximum Residue Limits (MRL)** in livestock systems.
By enabling farmers, veterinarians, regulators, and consumers to collaboratively track and validate livestock health data, CattleSense promotes **responsible antimicrobial stewardship**, **food safety**, and **traceability from farm to fork**.

This project aims to strengthen Indiaâ€™s compliance with global **AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance)** mitigation strategies and enhance consumer confidence in animal-derived food products such as milk, meat, and eggs.

## Background

Antimicrobials are essential in maintaining livestock health and productivity. However, **unregulated or excessive use** of these drugs leads to:

* Residues in animal products (milk, meat, eggs)
* Development of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**
* Public health risks and trade restrictions

Monitoring antimicrobial usage (AMU) and maintaining compliance with **Maximum Residue Limits (MRL)** are therefore critical to ensuring **food safety** and **sustainable livestock farming**.

## Problem Statement

Current livestock management systems in India provide limited capability for:

* Tracking real-time antimicrobial usage
* Ensuring MRL compliance before product processing or sale
* Enabling transparent data sharing between farmers, veterinarians, and regulators

There is a **need for a unified digital platform** that integrates health records, drug usage logs, veterinary approvals, and real-time alerts to ensure **responsible antimicrobial use** and **traceable livestock management**.

## Proposed Solution

**CattleSense** is a centralized **digital farm management portal** that enables:

* End-to-end monitoring of antimicrobial usage (AMU)
* Real-time compliance tracking with Maximum Residue Limits (MRL)
* Traceability from animal birth to consumer purchase

### Key Users

* **Farmers:** Record drug usage and receive alerts for withdrawal periods.
* **Veterinarians:** Verify prescriptions and monitor dosage trends.
* **Regulators:** Access real-time dashboards for compliance analytics.
* **Consumers:** Trace food origin and verify safety compliance.
